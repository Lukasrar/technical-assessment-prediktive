What you like about your implementation.
I believe the provider that manages the calendar as a whole is quite well organized.

What you would change if you were going to do it again.
I would change the way I implemented the matrix, considering generation by year instead of by month. This way, it would be easier to implement the navigation function to move forward and backward based on the view type month, week, or day.

How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
I used Google Calendar as my basis to develop this test.

How you would test this if you had more time.
I would test the rendering based on month, week, and day, as well as the creation, modification, and deletion of events
