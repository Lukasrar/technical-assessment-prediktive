# Project Name

## Overview

This project is a calendar application designed to manage events effectively. It includes features for viewing events in different formats and offers basic functionality for creating and editing events.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br />
For more information, refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation.

## Development Time

I spent considerable time on this assignment. You can check my activity on GitHub here: [GitHub Commits](https://github.com/Lukasrar/technical-assessment-prediktive/commits?author=Lukasrar).

## Implementation Highlights

### What I Like About My Implementation

I believe the calendar management provider is well-organized and provides a solid foundation for handling events.

### Improvements for Future Iterations

If I were to redo this project, I would change the implementation of the matrix to be generated by year instead of by month. This would simplify the implementation of navigation functions for different view types, such as month, week, or day.

### Design Decisions

I based my design on Google Calendar, drawing inspiration from its user interface and functionalities.

### Testing Approach

Given more time, I would focus on testing the rendering for different views (month, week, day) and ensure robust functionality for creating, modifying, and deleting events.

## Final Considerations

Unfortunately, I didn’t have time to add the drag-and-drop feature, the event timeline, or the ability to navigate forward and backward in the week and day views. Even so, I’m happy with how everything turned out and hope you find it useful.
